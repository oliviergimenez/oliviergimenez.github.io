I keep forgetting how to implement the so-called delta method in R that allows to get an approximation of this quantity. So in this post I go through two examples in population ecology that should help me remembering. I use the deltamethod function from the msm package.\nLoad the package msm and get some help on the delta-method function:\nlibrary(msm) ?deltamethod  Further examples can be obtained by typing in:\nexample(deltamethod)  For a nice introduction to the delta method, check that out. Two papers are worth reading on the topic: \u0026lsquo;Who Invented the Delta Method?' by Jay M. Ver Hoef and \u0026lsquo;Approximating variance of demographic parameters using the delta method: A reference for avian biologists\u0026rsquo; by Larkin A. Powell.\nSimple example A simple example is when, for example, you get $\\phi$ (ignore the traditional hat) an estimate of a survival probability on the logit scale in some capture-recapture analyses, and you would like to get the standard error (SE) of survival on its natural scale.\nFor example, say $\\text{logit}(\\phi) = \\text{lphi} = -0.4473122$ with $\\text{SE} = 0.3362757$.\nTo obtain $\\phi$, you back-transform $\\text{lphi}$ using the reciprocal function of the logit function: $$\\phi = \\displaystyle{\\frac{\\exp(\\text{lphi})}{1+\\exp(\\text{lphi})}} = \\displaystyle{\\frac{1}{1+\\exp(\\text{-lphi})}} = \\displaystyle{\\frac{1}{1+\\exp(\\text{-(-0.4473122)})}} = 0.39.$$\nWhat about the SE of $\\phi$? Well, a direct application of the deltamethod function from the msm package gives the answer:\ndeltamethod(~ 1/(1+exp(-x1)), -0.4473122, 0.3362757^2)  ## [1] 0.07999999  Two things to take care of:\n  First, the variables in the formula must be labelled $x_1, x_2, \\text{text}$. You cannot use $x, y, z, \u0026hellip;$ for example. Just numbered $x$\u0026rsquo;s.\n  Second, the input parameters are the estimate and its squared SE (not the SE), and by default you will get as an output the SE (not the squared SE) of the function defined by the formula.\n  Complex example This example deals with an occupancy model. It is a bit more complex than the previous example because we consider a function of several parameters for which we would like to calculate its SE. I assume that occupancy at first occasion was estimated along with its SE, and that one would like to obtain the SE of subsequent occupancy probabilities.\nI calculate time-dependent occupancy probabilities with the following formula $$\\psi_{t+1} = \\psi_t (1 - \\varepsilon) + (1 - \\psi_t) \\gamma$$ where $\\varepsilon$ is extinction, $\\gamma$ is colonisation and $\\psi_t$ is occupancy year $t$.\nWe assume that we obtained the following parameter estimates:\nepsilon = 0.39 gamma = 0.07 psi_init = 0.1 # first-occasion occupancy  with corresponding SEs:\nse_epsilon = 0.08 se_psi_init = 0.01 se_gamma = 0.05  We will estimate occupancy and get SEs at 10 occasions, which we store in two matrices (column vectors):\npsi = matrix(0, nrow = 10, ncol = 1) psi_se = matrix(0, nrow = 10, ncol = 1)  The first element is occupancy at first occasion:\npsi[1,] \u0026lt;- psi_init psi_se[1,] \u0026lt;- se_psi_init  Then we iterate calculations using the formula above:\nfor(i in 2:10){ psi_current \u0026lt;- psi[i-1,] psi_se_current \u0026lt;- psi_se[i-1,] estmean \u0026lt;- c(psi_current,epsilon,gamma) estvar \u0026lt;- diag(c(psi_se_current,se_epsilon,se_gamma)^2) psi[i,] = (psi_current*(1-epsilon)) + ((1-psi_current)*gamma) # recurrence formula psi_se[i,] = deltamethod(~ x1*(1-x2) + (1-x1)*x3, estmean, estvar) # delta-method }  Display results:\ndata.frame(psi = psi,sterr_psi = psi_se)  ## psi sterr_psi ## 1 0.1000000 0.01000000 ## 2 0.1240000 0.04602347 ## 3 0.1369600 0.05132740 ## 4 0.1439584 0.05244394 ## 5 0.1477375 0.05259904 ## 6 0.1497783 0.05255782 ## 7 0.1508803 0.05250010 ## 8 0.1514753 0.05245886 ## 9 0.1517967 0.05243372 ## 10 0.1519702 0.05241934  Here, we assumed that sampling correlation was 0, in other words that the estimates of $\\psi$, $\\gamma$ and $\\epsilon$ were independent, hence the use of a diagonal matrix for estvar. It is possible to use a non-diagonal covariance matrix to account for non-null correlation.\n","date":1546560000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546560000,"objectID":"7e0e44064021c26712608a491a4af7e7","permalink":"https://oliviergimenez.github.io/blog/delta-method/","publishdate":"2019-01-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/delta-method/","section":"blog","summary":"In statistical ecology, we often need to calculate the sampling variance of a function of an estimate of which we do know the sampling variance.

The code is available from [GitHub](https://github.com/oliviergimenez/simul_with_jags). Recently, I have been struggling with simulating data from complex hierarchical models. After several unsuccessful attempts in R, I remembered the good old times when I was using WinBUGS (more than 10 years already!) and the possibility to simulate data with it. I\u0026rsquo;m using JAGS now, and a quick search in Google with \u0026lsquo;simulating data with jags\u0026rsquo; led me to a complex example and a simple example.\nSimulating data with JAGS is convenient because you can use (almost) the same code for simulation and inference, and you can carry out simulation studies (bias, precision, interval coverage) in the same environment (namely JAGS).\nLinear regression example We first load the packages we need for this tutorial:\nlibrary(R2jags) library(runjags) library(mcmcplots)  Then straight to the point, let\u0026rsquo;s generate data from a linear regression model. The trick is to use a data block, have the simplest model block you could think of and pass the parameters as if they were data. Note that it\u0026rsquo;d be possible to use only a model block, see comment here.\ntxtstring \u0026lt;- ' data{ # Likelihood: for (i in 1:N){ y[i] ~ dnorm(mu[i], tau) # tau is precision (1 / variance) mu[i] \u0026lt;- alpha + beta * x[i] } } model{ fake \u0026lt;- 0 } '  Here, alpha and beta are the intercept and slope, tau the precision or the inverse of the variance, y the response variable and x the explanatory variable.\nWe pick some values for the model parameters that we will use as data:\n# parameters for simulations N = 30 # nb of observations x \u0026lt;- 1:N # predictor alpha = 0.5 # intercept beta = 1 # slope sigma \u0026lt;- .1 # residual sd tau \u0026lt;- 1/(sigma*sigma) # precision # parameters are treated as data for the simulation step data\u0026lt;-list(N=N,x=x,alpha=alpha,beta=beta,tau=tau)  Now call JAGS; note that we monitor the response variable instead of parameters as we would do when conducting standard inference:\n# run jags out \u0026lt;- run.jags(txtstring, data = data,monitor=c(\u0026quot;y\u0026quot;),sample=1, n.chains=1, summarise=FALSE)  ## Compiling rjags model... ## Calling the simulation using the rjags method... ## Note: the model did not require adaptation ## Burning in the model for 4000 iterations... ## Running the model for 1 iterations... ## Simulation complete ## Finished running the simulation  The output is a bit messy and needs to be formatted appropriately:\n# reformat the outputs Simulated \u0026lt;- coda::as.mcmc(out) Simulated  ## Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) output: ## Start = 5001 ## End = 5001 ## Thinning interval = 1 ## y[1] y[2] y[3] y[4] y[5] y[6] y[7] y[8] ## 5001 1.288399 2.52408 3.61516 4.583587 5.600675 6.566052 7.593407 8.457497 ## y[9] y[10] y[11] y[12] y[13] y[14] y[15] y[16] ## 5001 9.70847 10.38035 11.5105 12.55048 13.49143 14.46356 15.45641 16.56148 ## y[17] y[18] y[19] y[20] y[21] y[22] y[23] ## 5001 17.50935 18.51501 19.66197 20.49477 21.57079 22.6199 23.48232 ## y[24] y[25] y[26] y[27] y[28] y[29] y[30] ## 5001 24.57923 25.47368 26.33674 27.46525 28.35525 29.60279 30.42952  dim(Simulated)  ## [1] 1 30  dat = as.vector(Simulated) dat  ## [1] 1.288399 2.524080 3.615160 4.583587 5.600675 6.566052 7.593407 ## [8] 8.457497 9.708470 10.380351 11.510500 12.550482 13.491435 14.463564 ## [15] 15.456410 16.561483 17.509350 18.515005 19.661969 20.494767 21.570790 ## [22] 22.619899 23.482317 24.579228 25.473676 26.336736 27.465251 28.355248 ## [29] 29.602791 30.429517  Now let\u0026rsquo;s fit the model we used to simulate to the data we just generated.

I also have students who are now in the position to apply for such positions. It had me thinking about what works and what doesn't work in job applications and interviews. Here are my 2 cents suggestions. You can find plenty of more clever and relevant recommendations on the internet (see here, here or here for example). Also, be aware that these recommendations are specific to the French system, with little relevance for other countries.\nYour application\nRead and stick to the guidelines (not that obvious sometimes). The French academic system has some specific requirements to apply, in particular for faculty positions. Try to connect your CV with the job profile.\nDo not hesitate to include figures and boxes in the document. Structure does not hurt, well articulated sections are welcome. Be crystal clear on your current position. Synthetic tables summarizing the courses you taught, the talks you gave, the papers you published will help the referees to grab what is important in a minute (they obviously have more than your application to evaluate). Distinguish papers from oral presentations.\nSubmitted papers do not \u0026lsquo;count\u0026rsquo;. Use preprint servers such as arXiv or bioRxiv so that your referees get a chance to read what you\u0026rsquo;ve been working on lately (and judge the quality by themselves).\nProject yourself in the team/lab where the researcher will be hosted, and in the job itself. Feel free to get in touch with the host team/lab. Try to meet people beforehand. Visit websites. Get to know your hopefully-soon-to-be new lab. Show you\u0026rsquo;re interested in working with your hopefully-soon-to-be new colleagues. This might also help you find out about the \u0026lsquo;dismal job that everyone has been avoiding for years\u0026rsquo;.\nFor lecturer positions, even though it is not required, write a short project section including research objectives and do not forget your teaching objectives!\nHave your applications read by one or two colleagues, if possible someone who has experience in being on the kind of hiring committee you will have to face.\nYour interview\nBe on site the day before ( strikes in France happen).\nAppearances do matter, whether you like it or not, therefore pick something neutral and comfortable (my opinion).\nDo not use slides with too much text or complex figures (no tables please!), and point at your slides so that your visual support is part of your speech. Don\u0026rsquo;t look at the screen or the walls, try to look at the members of the jury. Occupy the space, don\u0026rsquo;t always stay at the same spot, but do not move too much (I\u0026rsquo;m useless at that).\nDo not rush when you talk, and give short answers so that every member of the committee gets a chance to ask you a question. Be honest: if you don\u0026rsquo;t know something, or if you don\u0026rsquo;t understand a question (which most likely means that members of the hiring committee do not understand this question either), say it.\nLast, but not least: rehearse, rehearse and rehearse again, there will be a moment where you do no longer sound like you know your text by heart, but rather, like saying it has become natural.\nFrom my experience, the round of questions is more determinant than the talk itself, but we have very rare opportunities to train on how to answer questions. Try to have sessions of questions with your colleagues to get better at it; it comes with experience, no secret.\nFor short talks in general, my advice is to write your text, at least for the first slides so that you\u0026rsquo;re confident you won\u0026rsquo;t get stuck when you start giving your speech. Make a video of yourself rehearsing and watch it; this is painful (I know by experience), but helpful.\nShow that you\u0026rsquo;re excited by the job offer, and that you like teaching and doing research. At the end of the day, I (sadly) vividly remember only a few candidates, most often those who demonstrated interest in the job and pleasure in doing what they do. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t good at inspiring that myself, but one thing that helped me was to think hard why I was applying, and to convince myself that I wanted the job so badly that I had to convince the committee that they should offer the job to me.\nLast but not least, do not do the job of the committee for the committee. In other words, do not censor yourself. Apply, and let the referees do their job.\nGood luck!\n","date":1502712000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1502712000,"objectID":"67174cc607328aa6d1a8b49954e4f365","permalink":"https://oliviergimenez.github.io/blog/interview_inra/","publishdate":"2017-08-14T12:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/interview_inra/","section":"blog","summary":"Over the years (age privilege), I sat on several hiring committees for French universities and research institutes.

Iago will spend next year improving his (already largely above the average) skills in informatics, AI, programming, agent-based modeling\u0026hellip; Hopefully, we’ll work again together.

We had a roundtable on the link between research, managers and citizens. We also had several short unorthodox talks where we tried to analyse why some of our papers/projects were successful, but also why we failed at being read or funded.
