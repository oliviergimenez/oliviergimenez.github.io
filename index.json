Conservation and the sustainable use of biodiversity and ecosystem services largely depend on the successful management of ecological populations, which in turn depend on our knowledge and our ability to understand and predict how the structure and dynamics of ecological populations respond to changes in their environments.\nRationale and aim. Despite its importance, the quantification of the effects of anthropic pressures on biodiversity is difficult and rarely undertaken because of the lack of species-specific ecological data and/or human pressures and activities, and the complexity and lack of transfer of analytical methods needed to evaluate these long-term consequences. The DISCAR (DIS = disturbance, CAR = carnivores) project aims at providing an operational framework with analytical tools for assessing the impacts or population consequences of human pressures, and showcasing it with case studies in applied conservation.\nCase study. In DISCAR, we will use small carnivores in French mainland and overseas territories as a case study to assess the population consequences or impacts of human pressures on animal populations. Why small carnivores? Because these species hold important roles in ecosystems, such as influencing ecosystem structure and providing numerous ecosystem services, including pest/disease control and seed dispersal. Small carnivore species also respond to ecosystem perturbation in a fast, measurable, and interpretable way and therefore can be used as sentinels of global change.\nObjectives. DISCAR will connect the fields of bioenergetics and demographic modeling in an integrated framework to assess human pressures on biodiversity, and to characterize then predict the impacts on small carnivores. DISCAR will identify key parameters underlying coupling between pressures and impacts, and will make recommendations for stakeholders in terms of monitoring and mitigation strategies.\nWork packages. We will i) assemble a unique dataset on small carnivores including their ecology, bioenergetic requirements, demography and human pressures, ii) quantify and characterize the impacts of interacting pressures on populations, and iii) forecast the fate of populations to assess their viability under various scenarios of pressures and mitigation to help devise sound conservation strategies.\nConsortium. To achieve these objectives, we have gathered international experts in ecological modelling and small carnivores who will develop and transfer an analytical framework for quantification, characterization and prediction of the impacts of pressures on populations.

To illustrate the course, we analyse data with generalized linear, often mixed, models or GLMMs.\nSo far, I\u0026rsquo;ve been using Jags to fit these models. This requires some programming skills, like e.g. coding a loop, to be able to write down the model likelihood. Although students learn a lot from going through that process, it can be daunting.\nThis year, I thought I\u0026rsquo;d show them the R package brms developed by Paul-Christian Bürkner. In brief, brms allows fitting GLMMs (but not only) in a lme4-like syntax within the Bayesian framework and MCMC methods with Stan.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not a Stan user, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter. The vignettes were more than enough to get me started. I also recommend the list of blog posts about brms.\nFirst things first, we load the packages we will need:\nlibrary(brms) library(posterior) # tools for working with posterior and prior distributions library(R2jags) # run Jags from within R library(lme4) # fit GLMM in frequentist framework Beta-Binomial model The first example is about a survival experiment. We captured, marked and released 57 individuals (total) out of which 19 made it through the year (alive).\ndat \u0026lt;- data.frame(alive = 19, total = 57) dat An obvious estimate of the probability of a binomial is the proportion of cases, $19/57 = 0.3333333$ here, but let\u0026rsquo;s use R built-in functions for the sake of illustration.\nMaximum-likelihood estimation To get an estimate of survival, we fit a logistic regression using the glm() function. The data are grouped (or aggregated), so we need to specify the number of alive and dead individuals as a two-column matrix on the left hand side of the model formula:\nmle \u0026lt;- glm(cbind(alive, total - alive) ~ 1, family = binomial(\u0026quot;logit\u0026quot;), # family = binomial(\u0026quot;identity\u0026quot;) would be more straightforward data = dat) On the logit scale, survival is estimated at:\ncoef(mle) # logit scale ## (Intercept) ## -0.6931472 After back-transformation using the reciprocal logit, we obtain:\nplogis(coef(mle)) ## (Intercept) ## 0.3333333 So far, so good.\nBayesian analysis with Jags In Jags, you can fit this model with:\n# model betabin \u0026lt;- function(){ alive ~ dbin(survival, total) # binomial likelihood logit(survival) \u0026lt;- beta # logit link beta ~ dnorm(0, 1/1.5) # prior } # data datax \u0026lt;- list(total = 57, alive = 19) # initial values inits \u0026lt;- function() list(beta = rnorm(1, 0, sd = 1.5)) # parameter to monitor params \u0026lt;- c(\u0026quot;survival\u0026quot;) # run jags bayes.jags \u0026lt;- jags(data = datax, inits = inits, parameters.to.save = params, model.file = betabin, n.chains = 2, n.iter = 5000, n.burnin = 1000, n.thin = 1) ## Compiling model graph ## Resolving undeclared variables ## Allocating nodes ## Graph information: ## Observed stochastic nodes: 1 ## Unobserved stochastic nodes: 1 ## Total graph size: 8 ## ## Initializing model # display results bayes.jags ## Inference for Bugs model at \u0026quot;/var/folders/r7/j0wqj1k95vz8w44sdxzm986c0000gn/T//RtmpP7MZ1A/modela81d72dd23e2.txt\u0026quot;, fit using jags, ## 2 chains, each with 5000 iterations (first 1000 discarded) ## n.sims = 8000 iterations saved ## mu.vect sd.vect 2.5% 25% 50% 75% 97.5% Rhat n.eff ## survival 0.342 0.061 0.228 0.300 0.341 0.382 0.466 1.001 2600 ## deviance 5.354 1.390 4.388 4.486 4.819 5.662 9.333 1.001 8000 ## ## For each parameter, n.eff is a crude measure of effective sample size, ## and Rhat is the potential scale reduction factor (at convergence, Rhat=1). ## ## DIC info (using the rule, pD = var(deviance)/2) ## pD = 1.0 and DIC = 6.3 ## DIC is an estimate of expected predictive error (lower deviance is better).

You can have a look to a list of distributions with ?brms::brmsfamily, and there is also a possibility to define custom distributions with custom_family().\nNote I haven\u0026rsquo;t covered diagnostics of convergence, more here. You can also integrate brms outputs in a tidy workflow with tidybayes, and use the ggplot() magic.\nAs usual, the code is on GitHub, visit https://github.com/oliviergimenez/fit-glmm-with-brms.\nNow I guess it\u0026rsquo;s up to the students to pick their favorite Bayesian tool.\n","date":1650240000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1650240000,"objectID":"d5f7f86edeba830f6265ddb3e1c354aa","permalink":"https://oliviergimenez.github.io/blog/glmm-brms/","publishdate":"2022-04-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/glmm-brms/","section":"blog","summary":"Here I illustrate how to fit GLMMs with the R package brms, and compare to Jags and lme4.\n","tags":["GLMM","bayes","R","brms","jags"],"title":"Bayesian analyses made easy: GLMMs in R package brms","type":"blog"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"8th conf of 🇫🇷 Statistical Ecology network #gdrEcoStat is about to start 🥳 We\u0026#39;re at 🏡 this year in @montpellier_ I\u0026#39;ll be tweeting today \u0026amp; tomorrow, hope it\u0026#39;ll pick your interest 😇🔇\n➡️ https://t.co/1MvnlFtSh3@INEE_CNRS @CNRS_OccitaniE @cefemontpellier @LbbeLyon @Ifremer_fr pic.twitter.com/PgeEPfx4UI\n\u0026mdash; Olivier Gimenez 🖖 (@oaggimenez) April 4, 2022 📸🥳 L\u0026#39;enregistrement vidéo des journées du #gdrEcoStat sont disponibles sur https://t.co/zptxN4JVol 😎 Jetez un coup d\u0026#39;oeil à la description de la vidéo pour accéder à une présentation par titre/orateur-trice.

The main goal of this challenge is to predict from the patients\u0026rsquo; CT scans who will develop severe illness from Covid.\nGiven my recent interest in machine learning, this challenge peaked my interest. Although Python is the machine learning lingua franca, it is possible to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) in R and perform (binary) image classification.\nHere, I will use an R interface to Keras that allows training neural networks. Note that the dataset shared for the challenge is big, like 280Go big, and it took me a day to download it.

I have written my two cents answers to her challenging and very relevant questions. Thank you Lise for the interview !\nCan you introduce yourself? What is your job about? Your background? My work is motivated by questions on the ecology of large mammals, and large carnivores in particular (wolves, bears and lynx).\nWhat questions ? Very basic questions at first glance: How many animals? Where are they? How to explain trends in population abundance and species distribution?\nThese questions might seem simple, but the issue is that large carnivores are difficult to see in the field. We need methods to sample these populations, to manage uncertainties in counting, in detecting individuals and species, and to predict as well, where and how many. This is where statistical ecology comes in.\nI am what you might call an ecological statistician, and I work for the National Centre for Scientific Research.\nI have a rather standard background. I studied mathematics up to Bachelor\u0026rsquo;s degree. A degree that I repeated, I still had nightmares about it until recently. Then, from the Master\u0026rsquo;s degree onwards, I turned to applied mathematics and statistics. I embarked on a PhD in statistics applied to ecology, and to the dynamics of animal populations, with the estimation of survival and dispersal. As a post-doc, I spent time in England and Scotland to see what it was like elsewhere, to build my own research network, and to learn English.\nOnce recruited, I became increasingly interested in evolutionary ecology and conservation issues. I also worked more and more on issues related to large mammals, and species that interact with human activities.\nTo better understand these interactions, we need the human and social sciences. So I went back to studying sociology. I took a few courses, but I couldn\u0026rsquo;t go all the way to the Master\u0026rsquo;s degree. I am still learning on the job.\nWhat is ecology for you? I am certainly not the right person to answer this question, I never studied ecology at university. I learned from my students and colleagues, and on the job.\nI like definitions, so I\u0026rsquo;m going for it. Ecology is the study of the processes that influence the distribution and abundance of species, the interactions between these species, and the interactions between these species and their environment. Maud Quéroué\u0026rsquo;s thesis is an example of the study of these interactions between species using new statistical models.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s the science of interactions in a nutshell, and that\u0026rsquo;s what I like about this discipline. Between species, between species and their environment. By species, I also mean humans. And here we come back to this idea of mobilising ecology, human and social sciences, and the study of socio-ecosystems in which we mix ecology, politics, economics, sociology and anthropology. Gilles Maurer\u0026rsquo;s thesis is an illustration of this approach, and combines demography, genetics, economics and anthropology to study the relationship between Asian elephants and humans.\nFinally, when we talk about ecology, we must understand it in a broad sense, with the idea that we are also talking about the evolutionary processes that contribute to explaining variability in biological systems. The theses of Marlène Gamelon and Mathieu Buoro are examples of work combining ecology and evolution to better understand the dynamics of animal populations.\nHow would you define statistical ecology? And modelling? In statistical ecology, statistical is the adjective that qualifies the noun ecology. It is ecology that motivates, that asks the questions. This does not make statistics a mere toolbox, but you have to accept the statements of ecology to make relevant statistics.\nComing from mathematics and statistics, this is something that did not come naturally to me. In statistics, one often sees the data from ecology as the numerical application to show that the statistical method works in the real world (often in addition to simulated data).\nI learned the importance of motivating statistics by ecological questions from Jean-Dominique Lebreton, one of my thesis directors, who himself got it from Jean-Marie Legay who thought a lot about the place of modelling in biology, and interdisciplinarity.\nStatistical ecology therefore means applying and above all developing statistical methods and tools to answer questions in ecology. In France, the scientific community meets on these themes in the statistical ecology research group which we created in 2014.\nStatistics in general is the science of collecting, analysing and drawing conclusions from data. All three are important for ecology. How we collect data to test ecological hypotheses. How we analyse it. And how you interpret the results.\nIt is at the analysis stage that models are mostly used. A model in this context is an abstraction of reality, based on what is known, and is used to extract information using probabilities. An example of a statistical model is a simple linear regression in which we try to pass a line through a scatter plot to explain a trend.\nHow is statistical ecology useful? Why is it important to ask the questions \u0026ldquo;where are the species?\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;how many animals are there?\u0026rdquo;? The species we study are in contact with humans and their activities. Fishing activities for bottlenose dolphins in the Mediterranean, for example, or sheep farming for wolves in France, to take another example.\nIn this context, I would say that statistical ecology and modelling serve three main purposes. To understand, to predict, and to help in decision making.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll take the example of the wolf, on which we do a lot of work with colleagues from the French Office for Biodiversity.\nFirst of all, we need to understand. We need to know the factors that explain the distribution of the species, this is information that allows us to establish the conservation status of a species. It was Julie Louvrier\u0026rsquo;s thesis that showed that the species is plastic and how it has recolonised the country.\nPredicting then. Julie also showed that it was possible to predict the short-term dispersal of the species with a mathematical model that was fitted to the data. As another example, Nina Santostasi in her thesis evaluated the effectiveness of different management scenarios for hybridisation between dogs and wolves in Italy.\nFinally, informing the management decision process. The species is managed by the French state, and it is on the basis of the numbers we produce thanks to statistical ecology that the maximum number of culls is established each year. This was Lucile Marescot\u0026rsquo;s thesis. We also need to know the effect of shooting on wolf predation of domestic livestock, a complex problem in spatial statistics. This is Oksana Grente\u0026rsquo;s recently defended thesis.\nTo sum up, there is a lot of discussion about biodiversity and ecosystem services, and therefore about the interdependence between humans and nature. A connection that is increasingly forgotten, to quote a theme dear to Alix Cosquer who is part of our team and works in environmental psychology.\nIn this context, statistical ecology is used to understand, predict and inform decision-making on the interactions between species, animals and humans, and their environment.\nWhy did you choose this career? Several reasons, in no particular order.\nIt is an incredible privilege to be paid to be a researcher, especially as a civil servant. Personally, I did not want to experience the difficult working conditions of my parents. Professionnaly, this status offers good conditions for doing our job. A permanent position allows us to work as a collective. This is an important point because research is an adventure involving several people, a team adventure; you don\u0026rsquo;t achieve anything, or not much, when you work alone (at least for me). You don\u0026rsquo;t do good research by pushing for more competition.\nOur status also allows us to take a long view, a long view that is essential for quality research, research that also serves society. Our work on the wolf, which I mentioned, began more than 10 years ago! This long time frame is being undermined by the precarization of employment which is hitting the research world hard, with more and more fixed-term contracts, and I am worried about the consequences for the younger generation of course. More competition. More administration. More excellence. Go fast. Quantity. Productivity. Fewer jobs. Fewer resources. Research and teaching are managed like a company, we have to optimise, rationalise, students are customers. It can\u0026rsquo;t work. Sorry, I\u0026rsquo;m going astray\u0026hellip; Another reason I chose this career is that I wanted to tackle applied problems, which could have concrete applications for people, for society. Or at least to contribute a little bit in that sense. To be useful, basically.\nAnother reason is that it is very (very) rewarding to accompany and support the new generation of scientists. It\u0026rsquo;s exciting, I love to walk the path with those who are embarking on a master\u0026rsquo;s degree, a thesis or a post-doc.\nFinally, this job allows you to be on the move all the time in your head. You learn all the time. You are constantly intellectually stimulated. I love that.\nDo you have to be good at math to do this job? We all have a maths hump. The sense of number, of counting. It is by training this sense that we improve, that we become better at maths. Like with a musical instrument.\nThe main obstacle is surely the language, because maths is also a language. Again like with music. You have to learn it to read it, to write it, and to understand what people who do it say to each other. With some efforts, you can really enjoy yourself.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s important to realise is that you can use maths in ecology at any level. From the simple rule of three, which I have mastered to the use of stochastic differential equations, which I have not understood. Everyone can find what they are looking for, and do relevant research. For statistics I recommend David Spiegelhalter\u0026rsquo;s book which introduces the discipline in a very accessible way.\nWhat do you like about what you do? First of all, it\u0026rsquo;s the people I work with. My biggest motivation comes from my students. I want to work with them, to exchange, to interact. It\u0026rsquo;s all about interactions. It\u0026rsquo;s also the people in our team. I\u0026rsquo;m learning all the time. And it\u0026rsquo;s the people in the statistical ecology community in France and abroad. It\u0026rsquo;s a community that doesn\u0026rsquo;t take itself too seriously, but that does serious and exciting research to answer the big questions about the biodiversity crisis. It is also very nice to feel part of a community. By the way, we are organising the next GDR Ecologie Statistique days in Montpellier at the beginning of April 2022, don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to join us!\nThe second thing, as I have already mentioned, is the fact that you are always on the move intellectually. You learn, you try things out, you explore, you play, you write, you read, you think, all the while feeling useful at your level in the construction of knowledge.\nThe third thing is sharing. Sharing knowledge by accompanying the students first of all, as I mentioned. And teaching too. I don\u0026rsquo;t do much as I\u0026rsquo;m already having trouble keeping my head above water with my job as a researcher. I admire my colleagues at universities who do two jobs, they are researchers and teachers! In sharing, I also include workshops that we offer over several days during which we train folks in statistical ecology methods. These workshops are free and video recorded so that as many people as possible have access to them.\nWhat are the future challenges of ecology? I have no idea! I don\u0026rsquo;t really consider myself an ecologist. The only things that come to mind are related to our research topics, of course. I think about biodiversity conservation. How do we find a balance, and a sustainable balance, between our activities and the nature around us? This means understanding better the interactions between human and non-human actors, why these interactions can lead to conflicts and how to resolve them. It also means working on complex systems, the so-called socio-ecosystems, and therefore opening up ecology even more to the human and social sciences.\nAnd the future challenges for statistics and modelling? I\u0026rsquo;m not necessarily more comfortable talking about future challenges for statistics and modelling, but we\u0026rsquo;ve thought about it a bit with colleagues from the GDR EcoStat, so I\u0026rsquo;m a bit less dry than for ecology. I see three.\nFirstly, the modelling of socio-ecosystems. There is a need to integrate different disciplines in agent-based approaches (economics, geography, ethnology). The question is how to use modelling approaches to estimate the many quantities in these complex models.\nWe have an explosion of technological means deployed at all scales of organisation. I am thinking of camera traps, environmental DNA, GPS, drones, aerial or satellite photos, etc. We are faced with a huge amount of data from which it is often difficult to extract the relevant information. The second challenge is therefore that of massive data, and the development of approaches that allow us to learn from this data and automate tasks that become impossible for humans to do. I am obviously thinking of machine learning, and deep learning in particular.\nThe third issue is predictive ecology. How can we predict ecological phenomena? This requires the manipulation of large-scale systems that couple ecology and physics, for example, or the ocean and the atmosphere, to take another example. It also requires thinking about how to propagate uncertainties throughout the analysis, right up to the prediction.\nIs there a tool, a school of thought, a discovery that has changed everything for you in your field? Yes, clearly! It is the introduction of Bayesian theory in the early 2000s. I discovered this theory as a post-doc in England and then in Scotland with my colleague Ruth King and others.\nWhat is the Bayesian theory? The idea is to update the a priori knowledge we have of a biological system with the data we accumulate on this system. This a priori knowledge can be seen as the confidence we have in a hypothesis, and the Bayesian theory allows us to update this degree of confidence thanks to the data. The Bayesian theory allows us to formalise the natural way of reasoning, to induce the chances that a hypothesis is true or false.\nThe Bayesian theory is used everywhere in science, but also in the everyday world, for example in medicine to make a diagnosis, in computer science to calibrate the anti-spam of your e-mail, in finance to manage stock portfolios, and it even allowed Alan Turing to crack the Enigma machine which allowed the Germans to communicate by coded messages.\nThe strength of the Bayesian theory also comes from the fact that it comes with very powerful algorithms to put it into practice. Very powerful in the sense that we can use increasingly complex models that are closer and closer to what we know about the species we are studying, models that we could not dream of using before.\nTo give you a concrete example, I can think of one. In ecology, we often try to model the distribution of species. This requires data on large areas to be sure that we have sampled all the habitats that are favourable or unfavourable to the species. This is difficult to do with a demanding and expensive scientific protocol. We can see that participatory science makes it possible to sample large areas at lower cost. But the data are biased because if we see a lot where there are observers, that doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that where there is no one, the species isn\u0026rsquo;t there; it simply means that where there are people, the species is detected. Bayesian analysis makes it possible to combine these different types of monitoring to quantify distribution by combining the advantages of both types of monitoring, unbiased data from scientific protocols, and wide spatial coverage from participatory programmes. This is the thesis of Valentin Lauret.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t get me started on Bayesian theory, I teach it in our Master\u0026rsquo;s programme and to PhD students in our doctoral school and I can\u0026rsquo;t get enough of it!\nCould you give an example of your work? Recently, we\u0026rsquo;ve been working a lot on the lynx in France. The main cause of mortality for the lynx is collisions with cars. A major challenge is therefore to find ways of reducing this mortality by collision. We have developed a model that allows us to evaluate scenarios to reduce this mortality. For example, building a wildlife crossing, basically a tunnel or a bridge through which animals can cross the road without risk. We wanted this tool to be used by those involved in the lynx dossier, and in particular by the regional government. We therefore encapsulated all the modelling components in a software that can be used by non-specialists. Everything is done in R, so it is open and reproducible!\nWhy did I choose to talk about this project specifically?\nFirstly because it is a project that mixes different types of modelling, statistical and computer science, different disciplines with ecology and statistics, and sub-disciplines of ecology with landscape ecology, movement ecology, and population dynamics.\nSecondly, because it was a project in which I questioned myself a lot. We chose to show the modelling to the actors with workshops where we presented the models and where we were put in place. The stakeholders had very high expectations, both in terms of the models, their use, the outputs, the long-term maintenance of the software and the updating of the data. In the end, co-construction enabled us to be much more relevant than if we had done the same modelling work in the laboratory.\nAlso in human terms, it is a project that ended well, since the post-doct who was the link between the different partners and who did most of the work, Sarah Bauduin, was recruited by the French Office for Biodiversity.\nFinally, it is a project that opens up other research questions, with a focus on connectivity problems due to fragmentation by land transport infrastructures (car and train). This is Maëlis Kervellec\u0026rsquo;s thesis which she has just started.\nAny message for young people who might be interested in this route? You mean the old fart\u0026rsquo;s message to the younger generation? I always find it difficult to give a message, to give advice. Especially because for me it worked, but clearly I was lucky, very lucky. What worked for me will not necessarily work for others. In that sense my message and my advice are not worth much.\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to cite Ted Lasso, and I\u0026rsquo;m going to say: be interested, read, ask questions, be curious about what other people are doing, and why they are doing it. Don\u0026rsquo;t listen too much to the advice of old people, and make your own way.\nAnd have fun, don\u0026rsquo;t take yourself too seriously!\nAn anecdote to share? A rather positive consequence of confinements. It\u0026rsquo;s the story of a training course in population dynamics that we offered in 2006 with about 30 participants at that time. We\u0026rsquo;re going for a reboot next year with two colleagues and friends of the team, Aurélien Besnard and Sarah Cubaynes. One tweet and a few messages to some mailing lists later, we have 2315 subscribers after 15 days! We\u0026rsquo;re not sure how we\u0026rsquo;re going to manage all these people, but it\u0026rsquo;s very exciting! Many of the people who have signed up come from countries where access to knowledge is difficult for many reasons. So we\u0026rsquo;re doing a free, online course, and we\u0026rsquo;re recording it. That\u0026rsquo;s where I\u0026rsquo;d like to go, more knowledge sharing. It sounds a bit grandiloquent, but there is a great need for biodiversity conservation.\n📢👋 Together with @SarahCubaynes and @abesnardEPHE we will be giving a 2-day introductory workshop March 21-22 on quantitative methods for population dynamics in R #rstats Join us 🥳 It\u0026#39;s online and free of charge 😉 You just need to register https://t.co/I5sNS5kDOo Please RT 😇 pic.twitter.com/rkw8JWZBJi\n\u0026mdash; Olivier Gimenez 🖖 (@oaggimenez) October 11, 2021 ","date":1638748800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1638748800,"objectID":"a283cd9c5c3b79896cc376d8c98c96e8","permalink":"https://oliviergimenez.github.io/blog/interview-ecostat-english/","publishdate":"2021-12-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/interview-ecostat-english/","section":"blog","summary":"I have been interviewed recently by Lise Viollat who\u0026rsquo;s preparing a documentary for our national research group in statistical ecology.

Très basiquement : combien y a-t-il d’animaux, et où sont-ils, et pourquoi ces effectifs et cette distribution.\nCes questions peuvent paraître très simples, mais le gros problème est qu’on ne peut pas facilement voir ces animaux. Il faut des méthodes pour échantillonner, pour gérer les incertitudes de comptage, de détection des individus et des espèces, et pour prédire aussi, combien et où. Et c’est là que les statistiques entrent en jeu.\nJe travaille en écologie statistique, je suis ce qu’on pourrait appeler un éco-statistien. Et je travaille au CNRS, le Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique.\nPour arriver au CNRS, j’ai eu un parcours plutôt classique. J’ai étudié les mathématiques jusqu’à la licence. Une licence que j’ai redoublée, j’en faisais encore des cauchemars jusqu’à récemment. Puis à partir du Master je me suis orienté vers les mathématiques appliquées avec les statistiques. Je me suis embarqué dans une thèse en statistique appliquée à l’écologie, et à la dynamique des populations d\u0026rsquo;animaux, avec l’estimation de la survie et de la dispersion. Après la thèse à Montpellier, j\u0026rsquo;ai fait un détour par Grenoble, puis je suis parti en Angleterre et en Ecosse pour voir comment c’était ailleurs, me faire mon propre réseau, et surtout apprendre l’anglais.\nUne fois recruté, je me suis de plus en plus intéressé aux questions d’écologie évolutive, et de conservation. J’ai aussi travaillé de plus en plus sur des questions en lien avec les grands mammifères, des espèces en interaction avec les activités humaines.\nPour mieux comprendre ces interactions, on fait appel aux sciences humaines et sociales. J’ai donc repris des études en sociologie. J\u0026rsquo;ai suivi quelques cours en licence, mais je n’ai pas pu aller au bout du Master. Je continue de me former sur le tas.\nQu\u0026rsquo;est-ce que pour vous l\u0026rsquo;écologie ? Je ne suis certainement pas la bonne personne pour répondre à la question, je n’ai jamais étudié l’écologie à l’université. J’ai appris au contact de mes étudiantes, de mes étudiants, et de mes collègues, et sur le tas.\nJ’aime bien les définitions, alors je me lance. L’écologie c’est l’étude des processus qui influencent la distribution et l’abondance des espèces, les interactions entre ces espèces, et les interactions entre ces espèces et leur environnement. La thèse de Maud Quéroué est un exemple de l\u0026rsquo;étude de ces interactions entre espèces grâce à de nouveaux modèles statistiques.\nC’est la science des interactions en bref, et c’est ça que j’aime dans cette discipline. Entre les espèces, entre les espèces et leur environnement. Dans les espèces, je mets aussi les humains. Et pour le coup on revient à cette idée de mobiliser écologie et sciences humaines et sociales, et l’étude des socio-écosystèmes dans lesquels on mélange écologie, politique, économie, sociologie et anthropologie. La thèse de Gilles Maurer est une illustration de cette démarche, et combine démographie, génétique, économie et anthropologie pour étudier les relations entre éléphant d’Asie et humains.\nPour finir, quand on parle d’écologie, il faut l’entendre au sens large, avec l’idée qu’on parle aussi des processus évolutifs qui contribuent à expliquer la variabilité dans les systèmes biologiques. Les thèses de Marlène Gamelon et Mathieu Buoro sont des exemples de travaux mêlant écologie et évolution pour mieux comprendre la dynamique des populations animales.\nComment est-ce que vous définiriez l\u0026rsquo;écologie statistique ? La modélisation ? Dans écologie statistique, l’ordre des mots est important. On ne dit pas statistique pour l’écologie. C’est l’écologie qui motive, qui pose les questions. Les statistiques n\u0026rsquo;en deviennent pas pour autant une simple boîte à outils, mais il faut accepter les énoncés de l’écologie pour faire des statistiques pertinentes.\nVenant des mathématiques et des statistiques, c’est quelque chose qui ne m’était pas naturel. En statistiques, on voit souvent les données de l’écologie comme l’application numérique pour montrer que la méthode statistique marche avec un exemple de données réelles (en complément aux données simulées souvent).\nJ’ai appris l’importance de motiver les statistiques par les questions écologiques au contact de Jean-Dominique Lebreton un de mes directeurs de thèse, qui le tenait lui-même de Jean-Marie Legay qui a beaucoup réfléchi sur la place de la modélisation en biologie, et l’interdisciplinarité.\nL’écologie statistique c’est donc appliquer et surtout développer des méthodes et des outils statistiques pour répondre aux questions de l’écologie. En France, la communauté scientifique se retrouve sur ces thèmes dans le groupement de recherche en écologie statistique que nous avons créé en 2014.\nLa statistique de manière générale, c’est la science qui permet de collecter, analyser et tirer des conclusions à partir des données. Les trois sont importants pour l’écologie. Comment on récolte des données pour tester des hypothèses écologiques. Comment on les analyse. Et comment on interprète les résultats.\nC’est à l’étape d’analyse qu’on utilise surtout des modèles. Un modèle dans ce contexte c’est une abstraction de la réalité, qui se base sur ce qu’on sait, et qu’on utilise pour extraire de l’information en utilisant les probabilités. Un exemple de modèle statistique c’est la régression linéaire simple dans laquelle on essaye de faire passer une droite dans un nuage de point pour expliquer une tendance.\nA quoi elles servent d\u0026rsquo;après vous ? Pourquoi est-il important de poser les questions \u0026ldquo;où sont les espèces?\u0026rdquo;, et \u0026ldquo;combien y a-t-il d’animaux?\u0026rdquo;. Les espèces qu’on étudie sont au contact des humains, et de leurs activités. Les activités de pêche pour le grand dauphin en Méditerranée par exemple, ou l’élévage d’ovins pour les loups en France pour prendre un autre exemple.\nDans ce contexte, je dirais que l’écologie statistique et la modélisation servent principalement à trois choses. Comprendre, prédire, et aider à la décision.\nJe prends l’exemple du loup sur lequel on travaille beaucoup avec les collègues de l’ Office Français de la Biodiversité.\nComprendre d’abord. On a besoin de connaître les facteurs qui expliquent la distribution de l’espèce, ce sont des informations qui permettent d’établir le statut de conservation par exemple, celui de l’UICN. C’était la thèse de Julie Louvrier qui a permis de montrer que l’espèce est plastique et la façon dont l’espèce a recolonisé le pays.\nPrédire ensuite. Julie a aussi montré qu’on pouvait prédire à court terme la dispersion de l’espèce avec un modèle mathématique qu’on confrontait aux données. Autre exemple, dans sa thèse, Nina Santostasi a évalué l\u0026rsquo;efficacité de différents scénarios de gestion de l\u0026rsquo;hybridation entre chiens et loups en Italie.\nEnfin, l’aide à la décision. L’espèce est gérée par l’état français, et c’est entre autres sur la base d’effectifs que nous produisons grâce à l’écologie statistique que le nombre maximal de prélèvements est établi chaque année. C’était la thèse de Lucile Marescot. On a aussi besoin de connaître l’effet des tirs mis en place sur la prédation par le loup des troupeaux domestiques, un problème complexe de statistique spatiale. C’est la thèse d’Oksana Grente qui a soutenu récemment.\nPour résumer, on parle beaucoup de biodiversité et de services rendus par les écosystèmes, et donc d’interdépendance entre les humains et la nature. Une connexion qui s’oublie de plus en plus pour reprendre un thème cher à Alix Cosquer qui travaille dans notre équipe en psychologie de l’environnement.\nDans ce contexte, l’écologie statistique sert à comprendre, à prédire et à informer la prise de décision sur les interactions entre les espèces, animaux et humains, et leur environnement.\nPourquoi avoir choisi cette carrière ? Plusieurs raisons, dans le désordre.\nC’est un privilège incroyable que d’être payé pour faire le métier de chercheur, qui plus est avec le statut de fonctionnaire. A titre personnel, je ne voulais pas connaître les conditions de travail difficiles de mes parents. A titre professionnel, ce statut offre de bonnes conditions pour faire notre métier. Un poste permanent permet de travailler en collaborant avec les collègues. C’est un point important car la recherche c’est une aventure à plusieurs, une aventure d’équipe ; on n’arrive à rien, ou à pas grand-chose, quand on travaille seul (en tous cas moi). On ne fait pas une bonne recherche en poussant à plus de compétition. Notre statut permet aussi de s’inscrire dans un temps long, ce temps long qui est indispensable à une recherche de qualité, une recherche qui sert la société aussi. Nos travaux sur le loup dont je parlais ont commencé il y a plus de 10 ans ! Ce temps long est mis à mal par la précarisation de l’emploi qui touche le monde de la recherche de plein fouet, avec de plus en plus de CDDs, et je m’inquiète des conséquences pour la jeune génération bien sûr. Plus de compétition. Plus d’administratif, plus d’excellence. Aller vite. Quantité. Productivité. Moins de postes. Moins de moyens. On gère la recherche et l’enseignement comme une entreprise, il faut optimiser, rationnaliser, les étudiants sont des clients. Ca ne peut pas marcher. Désolé je m\u0026rsquo;égare\u0026hellip;\nUne autre raison pour laquelle j\u0026rsquo;ai choisi cette carrière est que j’avais envie de m’attaquer à des problèmes appliqués, qui pourraient avoir des applications concrètes pour les gens, pour la société. Ou au moins de contribuer un peu en ce sens. Être utile en gros.\nUn autre raison est qu\u0026rsquo;il est très (très) gratifiant d’accompagner la nouvelle génération de scientifiques. C’est excitant, j’adore faire un bout de chemin avec celles et ceux qui s\u0026rsquo;embarquent dans un master, une thèse, ou un post-doc.\nEnfin, ce métier permet d’être tout le temps en mouvement dans sa tête. On apprend tout le temps. On est en permanence stimulé intellectuellement. J’adore ça.\nFaut-il être douer en math pour faire ce métier ? Ca veut dire quoi « doué en maths » en fait ? Ca fait penser à cette expression « avoir la bosse des maths ». Cette expression vient du 19ème siècle et d’une pseudo-science qui s’appelait la phrénologie. On établissait un lien entre vos capacités ou traits de caractères et les régions du cerveau, avec l’idée que ça se répercutait sur la forme du crâne. Les bons en maths avaient une bosse sur le front qui correspondait à l’endroit supposé du cerveau où se faisait les maths. C\u0026rsquo;est absurde! On a montré depuis que les mathématiques mobilisent différentes zones du cerveau.\nIl y a un bouquin très chouette de Stanislas Dehaene professeur au collège de France en psychochologie cognitive qui s’appelle justement la bosse des maths. Que dit ce bouquin? On a tous la bosse des maths. Le sens du nombre, du dénombrement. C’est en entrainant ce sens qu’on s’améliore, qu’on devient meilleur en maths. Comme avec un instrument de musique.\nLe principal obstacle est sûrement le langage, car les maths c’est aussi un langage. A nouveau comme en musique. Ca demande de l’apprendre pour la lire, l’écrire, et comprendre ce que se disent les gens qui en font. Une fois qu’on a fait nos gammes, on peut vraiment s’amuser, se faire plaisir.\nCe qui est important de réaliser, c’est qu’on peut utiliser les maths en écologie quel que soit son niveau. De la simple règle de trois que je maitrise à peu près, jusqu’à l’utilisation des équations différentielles stochastiques auxquelles je n’ai rien compris. Chacun et chacune peut y trouver son bonheur, et faire une recherche tout à fait pertinente. Pour les statistiques je conseille le livre de David Spiegelhalter qui introduit la discipline de façon très abordable.\nQu\u0026rsquo;est ce qui vous plait dans ce que vous faite ? C\u0026rsquo;est d\u0026rsquo;abord les personnes avec qui je travaille. Ma plus grosse motivation vient de mes étudiantes et de mes étudiants. J’ai envie de travailler avec eux, d’échanger, d’interagir. On en revient aux interactions. Ce sont aussi les gens de mon équipe. J’apprends tout le temps. Et ce sont les gens de la communauté en écologie statistique en France et à l’étranger. C’est une communauté qui ne se prend pas trop au sérieux, mais qui fait une recherche sérieuse et excitante pour répondre aux grandes questions qu’on se pose sur la crise de la biodiversité. C’est aussi très agréable de se sentir appartenir à une communauté. A ce propos, nous organisons les prochaines journées du GDR Ecologie Statistique à Montpellier début avril 2022, n\u0026rsquo;hésitez pas à nous rejoindre !\nLa deuxième chose, je l’ai déjà mentionné, c’est le fait d’exercer un métier dans lequel on est toujours en mouvement intellectuellement. On apprend, on essaye, on tente des choses, on explore, on joue, on écrit, on lit, on réfléchit, tout en se sentant utile à son niveau à la construction des connaissances.\nLa troisième chose c’est le partage. Le partage des connaissances via l’accompagnement des étudiantes et des étudiants d’abord, j’en ai parlé. Et l’enseignement aussi. J’en fais peu quand on compare aux collègues de l’enseignement supérieur qui forcent le respect. J’ai déjà du mal à garder la tête hors de l’eau avec mon métier de chercheur, eux en font deux, ils sont chercheurs et enseignants ! Dans le partage, je mets aussi des ateliers que nous proposons sur plusieurs jours au cours desquels on forme aux méthodes de l’écologie statistique. Ce sont des formations gratuites et filmées pour que le plus grand nombre y ait accès.\nQuels sont les futurs enjeux de l\u0026rsquo;écologie ? Je n\u0026rsquo;en sais rien du tout! Je ne me considère pas vraiment comme un écologue. Les seules choses qui me viennent à l’esprit sont en lien avec nos thématiques de recherche évidemment. Je pense à la conservation de la biodiversité. Comment trouver un équilibre, et un équilibre durable entre nos activités et la nature qui nous entoure? Ca sous-entend mieux comprendre les interactions entre les acteurs humains et non-humains, pourquoi ces interactions peuvent mener à des conflits et comment les résoudre. Ca veut dire aussi travailler sur des systèmes complexes, ces fameux socio-écosystèmes, et donc encore plus d’ouverture de l’écologie aux sciences humaines et sociales.\nDes statistiques et de la modélisation ? Je suis pas forcément plus à l’aise pour parler des enjeux en statistiques, mais on y a un peu réfléchi avec les collègues du GDR EcoStat, et je suis donc un peu moins sec que pour l’écologie. J’en vois trois.\nLa modélisation des socio-écosystèmes d’abord. Il y a besoin d’intégrer différentes disciplines dans des approches multi-agents (économie, géographie, ethnologie). On se demande comment utiliser les approches de modélisation pour estimer les quantités importantes de ces modèles complexes.\nOn a une explosion des moyens technologiques déployés à toutes les échelles d’organisation. Je pense aux pièges photos, à l\u0026rsquo;ADN environnemental, aux GPS, aux drones, aux photos aériennes ou satellites, etc. Nous sommes face à une masse conséquente de données dont il est souvent difficile d’extraire l’information pertinente. Le deuxième enjeu est donc celui des données massives, et du développement d’approches qui permettent d’apprendre de ces données, et d’automatiser des tâches qui deviennent impossibles à faire par des humains. Je pense évidemment au machine learning, et au deep learning en particulier.\nLe troisième enjeu est celui de l’écologie prédictive. Comment prédire les phénomènes écologiques? Ca demande de manipuler des systèmes de grandes dimensions qui couplent écologie et physique par exemple, ou océan et atmosphère pour prendre un autre exemple. Ca demande aussi de réfléchir à comment propager les incertitudes d’estimation et d’échantillonnage tout le long de l’analyse, jusqu’à la prédiction.\nY a-t-il un outil, un courant de pensée, une découverte qui pour vous a tout changé dans votre domaine ? Oui, clairement! C’est l’introduction de la théorie bayésienne au début des années 2000. J’ai découvert cette théorie en post-doc en Angleterre puis en Ecosse avec ma collègue Ruth King et d’autres.\nQu’est-ce que le bayésien ? L’idée est de mettre à jour la connaissance a priori qu’on a d’un système qu’on étudie grâce à l’expérimentation, avec les données qu’on accumule sur ce système. Cette connaissance a priori, on peut la voir comme la confiance qu’on a en une hypothèse, et le bayésien permet alors de mettre à jour ce degré de confiance grâce aux données. Le bayésien permet de formaliser la façon naturelle qu’on a de raisonner, d’induire les chances qu’une hypothèse soit vraie ou fausse.\nLa théorie bayésienne est utilisée un peu partout en sciences, mais aussi dans le monde de tous les jours par exemple en médecine pour faire un diagnostic, en informatique pour calibrer l’anti-spam de votre boîte électronique, en finance pour gérer des portfolios d’actions, et elle a même permis à Alan Turing de craquer la machine Enigma qui permettait aux allemands de communiquer par messages codés.\nLa force de la théorie bayésienne vient aussi du fait qu’elle vient avec des algorithmes pour la mettre en pratique qui sont très puissants. Très puissants au sens où on peut utiliser des modèles de plus en plus complexes et de plus en plus proches de ce qu’on sait des espèces qu’on étudie, des modèles qu’on ne pouvait pas rêver d’utiliser avant.\nPour vous donner du concret, je pense à un exemple. En écologie on cherche souvent à modéliser la distribution des espèces. Ca demande d’avoir des données sur des grandes surfaces pour être sûr qu’on a échantillonné tous les habitats favorables ou pas à l’espèce. C’est difficile à faire avec un protocole scientifique exigeant et coûteux. On voit que les sciences participatives permettent d’échantillonner à moindre coût sur de grandes surfaces. Mais les données sont biaisées car si on voit beaucoup là où il y a des observateurs et observatrices, ça ne veut pas dire que là où il n’y a personne, il n’y a pas l’espèce ; ça veut simplement dire que là où on a des gens, l’espèce est détectée. L’analyse bayésienne permet de combiner ces différents suivis pour quantifier la distribution en combinant les avantages des deux types de suivi, des données non-biaisées par les protocoles scientifiques, et une grande couverture spatiale par les programmes participatifs. C\u0026rsquo;est la thèse de Valentin Lauret.\nIl ne faut pas me lancer sur la théorie bayésienne, je l\u0026rsquo;enseigne en Master et pour les doctorants et doctorantes de notre école doctorale et je ne m\u0026rsquo;en lasse pas!\nPourriez vous donnez un exemple d\u0026rsquo;un de vos travaux ? C’est un travail sur le lynx en France. La première cause de mortalité du lynx sont les collisions avec les voitures. Un gros enjeu consiste donc à trouver des moyens de réduire cette mortalité par collision. On a développé un modèle qui permet d’évaluer des scénarios pour réduire cette mortalité. Par exemple construire un passage à faune, en gros un tunnel ou un pont par lequel les animaux peuvent traverser la route sans risque. On a voulu que cet outil puisse être utilisé par les acteurs du dossier lynx, et en particulier par l’état en région via les DREAL (Direction régionale de l\u0026rsquo;Environnement, de l\u0026rsquo;Aménagement et du Logement). On a donc encapsulé toutes les composantes modélisation dans un logiciel utilisable par des non-spécialistes. Tout est fait dans le logiciel R, donc le tout est ouvert et reproductible !\nPourquoi j’ai choisi ce projet ?\nD\u0026rsquo;abord parce que c\u0026rsquo;est un projet qui mélange différents types de modélisation, statistique et informatique, différentes disciplines avec écologie et statistique, et sous-disciplines de l’écologie avec écologie du paysage, écologie du déplacement, et la dynamique des populations.\nEnsuite parce qu\u0026rsquo;humainement c’est un projet au cours duquel je me suis beaucoup remis en question. On a choisi de montrer la modélisation aux acteurs avec des ateliers où on a présenté les modèles, et où on s’est fait remettre en place. Les acteurs avaient un niveau d’exigence très élevé, à la fois sur les modèles, sur leur utilisation, les sorties, le maintien à long terme du logiciel et la mise à jour des données. Au final, la co-construction nous a permis d’être beaucoup plus pertinents que si on avait fait le même travail de modélisation au laboratoire.\nToujours humainement, c’est un projet qui finit bien, puisque la post-doctorante qui a été le trait d’union entre les différents partenaires, et qui a fait l’essentiel du travail, Sarah Bauduin, a été recrutée à l’Office Français de la Biodiversité.\nEnfin, c’est un projet qui ouvre sur d’autres questions de recherche, avec un focus sur les problèmes de connectivité dus à la fragmentation par les infrastructures de transports terrestres (voiture et train). C’est la thèse de Maëlis Kervellec qu’elle vient tout juste de démarrer.\nUn message pour les jeunes qui pourrait être intéresser par cette voie ? Vous voulez dire le message du vieux con à la jeune génération? Je trouve toujours difficile de passer un message, de donner un conseil. D’autant que pour moi ça a marché, mais clairement j’ai eu de la chance, beaucoup de chance. Ce qui a marché pour moi ne marchera pas forcément pour d’autres. En ce sens mon message et mes conseils ne valent pas grand-chose.\nJe vais vous faire du Ted Lasso, et je dirais : intéressez-vous, lisez, posez des questions, soyez curieux de ce que font les autres, et pourquoi ils le font. N’écoutez pas trop les conseils des vieux, et faites votre propre chemin.\nEt rigolez, ne vous prenez pas trop au sérieux !\nUne anecdote à partager ? Une conséquence plutôt positive des confinements. C’est l’histoire d’une formation en dynamique des populations que nous avons proposée en 2006 avec une 30aine de participants à l’époque. J’ai relancé ça avec deux collègues et amis de l’équipe, Aurélien Besnard et Sarah Cubaynes. Un tweet et deux messages à des mailing lists plus tard, on en est à 2315 inscrits au bout de 15 jours ! On ne sait pas trop comment on va gérer tous ces gens, mais c’est très excitant ! Beaucoup de personnes inscrites viennent de pays où l\u0026rsquo;accès à la connaissance est difficile pour des tas de raisons. On fait donc une formation gratuite et en ligne, et on l’enregistre. C’est vers là que j’aimerais aller, plus de partage de la connaissance. Ça fait un peu grandiloquent, mais les besoins sont criants pour la conservation de la biodiversité.\n📢👋 Together with @SarahCubaynes and @abesnardEPHE we will be giving a 2-day introductory workshop March 21-22 on quantitative methods for population dynamics in R #rstats Join us 🥳 It\u0026#39;s online and free of charge 😉 You just need to register https://t.co/I5sNS5kDOo Please RT 😇 pic.twitter.com/rkw8JWZBJi\n\u0026mdash; Olivier Gimenez 🖖 (@oaggimenez) October 11, 2021 ","date":1638144000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1638144000,"objectID":"1c237477f79151fbe0b06632e7aaadf1","permalink":"https://oliviergimenez.github.io/blog/interview-ecostat/","publishdate":"2021-11-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/interview-ecostat/","section":"blog","summary":"Dans le cadre d\u0026rsquo;un documentaire que réalise Lise Viollat, celle-ci m\u0026rsquo;a posé des questions sur mon parcours en recherche, et en écologie statistique.

So I have been reading and learning by doing. I thought I\u0026rsquo;d share my experience for others who\u0026rsquo;d like to give it a try1.\nFirst version August 13, 2021, updated August 23, 2021 Since my first post, I’ve been reading notebooks shared by folks who ranked high in the challenge, and added two features that they used. Eventually, these new predictors did not help (I must be doing something wrong). I also explored some other ML algorithms. Last, I tuned the parameters more efficiently with a clever grid-search algorithm. All in all, I slightly improved my score, but most importantly, I now have a clean template for further use.\nMotivation All material available from GitHub at https://github.com/oliviergimenez/learning-machine-learning.\nThe two great books I’m using are:\nAn Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani\nTidy models in R by Max Kuhn and Julia Silge\nI also recommend checking out the material (codes, screencasts) shared by David Robinson and Julia Silge from whom I picked some useful tricks that I put to use below.\nTo try things, I’ve joined the Kaggle online community which gathers folks with lots of experience in ML from whom you can learn. Kaggle also hosts public datasets that can be used for playing around.\nI use the tidymodels metapackage that contains a suite of packages for modeling and machine learning using tidyverse principles. Check out all possibilities here, and parsnip models in particular there.\nLet’s start with the famous Titanic dataset. We need to predict if a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic (1) or not (0). A dataset is provided for training our models (train.csv). Another dataset is provided (test.csv) for which we do not know the answer. We will predict survival for each passenger, submit our answer to Kaggle and see how well we did compared to other folks. The metric for comparison is the percentage of passengers we correctly predict – aka as accuracy.\nFirst things first, let’s load some packages to get us started.\nlibrary(tidymodels) # metapackage for ML library(tidyverse) # metapackage for data manipulation and visulaisation library(stacks) # stack ML models for better perfomance theme_set(theme_light()) doParallel::registerDoParallel(cores = 4) # parallel computations Data Read in training data.\nrawdata \u0026lt;- read_csv(\u0026quot;dat/titanic/train.csv\u0026quot;) glimpse(rawdata) ## Rows: 891 ## Columns: 12 ## $ PassengerId \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;

Maybe better tuning, better features (or predictors) or other algorithms would increase accuracy. Of course, I forgot to use set.seed() so results are not exactly reproducible.\nThis post was also published on https://www.r-bloggers.com.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","date":1628812800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1628812800,"objectID":"6d1999265d6ae3cfa97cff110ffd9567","permalink":"https://oliviergimenez.github.io/blog/learning-machine-learning/","publishdate":"2021-08-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/learning-machine-learning/","section":"blog","summary":"I would like to familiarize myself with machine learning (ML) techniques in R.

To do so, I use R to retrieve some data from Twitter using rtweet, do some data exploration and visualisation using the tidyverse and examine my network of followers with tidygraph, ggraph and igraph. Data and codes are available from https://github.com/oliviergimenez/sna-twitter.\nTo reproduce the analyses below, you will need to access a Twitter API (application programming interface) to retrieve the information about your followers. In brief, an API is an intermediary application that allows applications to talk to each other. To access the Twitter APIs, you need a developer account for which you may apply at https://developer.twitter.com/en. There is a short form to fill in, and it takes less than a day to get an answer.\nBelow I rely heavily on the code shared by Joe Cristian through the Algoritma Technical Blog at https://algotech.netlify.app/blog/social-network-analysis-in-r/. Kuddos and credits to him.\nData retrieving We load the rtweet package to work with Twitter from R.\n#devtools::install_github(\u0026quot;ropensci/rtweet\u0026quot;) library(rtweet) We also load the tidyverse for data manipulation and visualisation.\nlibrary(tidyverse) theme_set(theme_light(base_size = 14)) First we need to get credentials. The usual rtweet sequence with rtweet_app, auth_save and auth_as is supposed to work (see here), but the Twitter API kept failing (error 401) for me. Tried a few things, in vain. I will use the deprecated create_token function instead. You might need to change the defaults of your Twitter app from \u0026ldquo;Read only\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;Read, write and access direct messages\u0026rdquo;.\nEnter my API keys and access tokens (not shown), then authenticate.\ntoken \u0026lt;- create_token( app = \u0026quot;sna-twitter-network-5k\u0026quot;, consumer_key = api_key, consumer_secret = api_secret_key, access_token = access_token, access_secret = access_token_secret) Get my Twitter info with my description, number of followers, number of likes, etc.\nog \u0026lt;- lookup_users(\u0026quot;oaggimenez\u0026quot;) str(og, max = 2) ## 'data.frame':\t1 obs. of 21 variables: ## $ id : num 7.51e+17 ## $ id_str : chr \u0026quot;750892662224453632\u0026quot; ## $ name : chr \u0026quot;Olivier Gimenez \\U0001f596\u0026quot; ## $ screen_name : chr \u0026quot;oaggimenez\u0026quot; ## $ location : chr \u0026quot;Montpellier, France\u0026quot; ## $ description : chr \u0026quot;Scientist (he/him) @CNRS @cefemontpellier @twitthair1 • Grown statistician • Improvised ecologist • Sociologist\u0026quot;| __truncated__ ## $ url : chr \u0026quot;https://t.co/l7NImYeGdY\u0026quot; ## $ protected : logi FALSE ## $ followers_count : int 5042 ## $ friends_count : int 2191 ## $ listed_count : int 68 ## $ created_at : chr \u0026quot;Thu Jul 07 03:22:16 +0000 2016\u0026quot; ## $ favourites_count : int 18066 ## $ verified : logi FALSE ## $ statuses_count : int 5545 ## $ profile_image_url_https: chr \u0026quot;https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1330619806396067845/mIPmR-x4_normal.jpg\u0026quot; ## $ profile_banner_url : chr \u0026quot;https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_banners/750892662224453632/1602417664\u0026quot; ## $ default_profile : logi FALSE ## $ default_profile_image : logi FALSE ## $ withheld_in_countries :List of 1 ## ..$ : list() ## $ entities :List of 1 ## ..$ :List of 2 ## - attr(*, \u0026quot;tweets\u0026quot;)='data.frame':\t1 obs. of 36 variables: ## ..$ created_at : chr \u0026quot;Thu Jul 29 16:15:52 +0000 2021\u0026quot; ## ..$ id : num 1.42e+18 ## ..$ id_str : chr \u0026quot;1420780122949529601\u0026quot; ## ..$ text : chr \u0026quot;Looking forward to digging into this paper \\U0001f929\\U0001f9ee\\U0001f60d https://t.co/ddCMraM3kj\u0026quot; ## ..$ truncated : logi FALSE ## ..$ entities :List of 1 ## ..$ source : chr \u0026quot;\u0026lt;a href=\\\u0026quot;http://twitter.com/download/iphone\\\u0026quot; rel=\\\u0026quot;nofollow\\\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Twitter for iPhone\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026quot; ## ..$ in_reply_to_status_id : logi NA ## ..$ in_reply_to_status_id_str : logi NA ## ..$ in_reply_to_user_id : logi NA ## ..$ in_reply_to_user_id_str : logi NA ## ..$ in_reply_to_screen_name : logi NA ## ..$ geo : logi NA ## ..$ coordinates :List of 1 ## ..$ place :List of 1 ## ..$ contributors : logi NA ## ..$ is_quote_status : logi TRUE ## ..$ quoted_status_id : num 1.42e+18 ## ..$ quoted_status_id_str : chr \u0026quot;1420768369620312065\u0026quot; ## ..$ retweet_count : int 0 ## ..$ favorite_count : int 8 ## ..$ favorited : logi FALSE ## ..$ retweeted : logi FALSE ## ..$ possibly_sensitive : logi FALSE ## ..$ lang : chr \u0026quot;en\u0026quot; ## ..$ quoted_status :List of 1 ## ..$ display_text_width : int 70 ## ..$ user :List of 1 ## ..$ full_text : logi NA ## ..$ favorited_by : logi NA ## ..$ display_text_range : logi NA ## ..$ retweeted_status : logi NA ## ..$ quoted_status_permalink : logi NA ## ..$ metadata : logi NA ## ..$ query : logi NA ## ..$ possibly_sensitive_appealable: logi NA Now I obtain the id of my followers using get_followers.\nfollowers \u0026lt;- get_followers(user = \u0026quot;oaggimenez\u0026quot;, n = og$followers_count, retryonratelimit = T) From their id, I can get the same details I got on my account using lookup_users.

Unfortunately, the Twitter API imposes some time and quantity constraints in retrieving data.\nHere, for the sake of illustration, I will focus on some accounts only. To do so, I consider accounts with between 1000 and 1500 followers, and more than 30000 tweets users have liked in their account\u0026rsquo;s lifetime (which denotes some activity). The more followers we consider, the more time it would take to gather info on them: it is approx one minute per follower on average, so one hour for sixty followers, and more than eighty hours for all my followers! With the filters I\u0026rsquo;m using, I end up with 35 followers here, this is very few to say infer meaningful about a network, but it\u0026rsquo;ll do the job for now.\nsome_followers \u0026lt;- details_followers %\u0026gt;% filter((followers_count \u0026gt; 1000 \u0026amp; followers_count \u0026lt; 1500), favourites_count \u0026gt; 30000) # %\u0026gt;% nrow() Create empty list and name it after their screen name.\nfoler \u0026lt;- vector(mode = 'list', length = length(some_followers$screen_name)) names(foler) \u0026lt;- some_followers$screen_name Get followers of these selected followers.

He has the most relations with the other nodes in the network. He also can spread information the further away and faster than anyone, and is also surrounded by important persons in the network. This is within the network we\u0026rsquo;ve just built.\nBy the way, Robbie has just passed his dissertation defense, congrats! Follow him on Twitter at @robbie_emmet, he is awesome!\nVisualize Network We visualize the network using clusters or communities (first three only).\noptions(ggrepel.max.overlaps = Inf) network_viz \u0026lt;- network_ego1 %\u0026gt;% filter(community %in% 1:3) %\u0026gt;% mutate(node_size = ifelse(degree_c \u0026gt;= 50,degree_c,0)) %\u0026gt;% mutate(node_label = ifelse(betweenness_c \u0026gt;= 0.01,name,NA)) plot_ego \u0026lt;- network_viz %\u0026gt;% ggraph(layout = \u0026quot;stress\u0026quot;) + geom_edge_fan(alpha = 0.05) + geom_node_point(aes(color = as.factor(community),size = node_size)) + geom_node_label(aes(label = node_label),nudge_y = 0.1, show.legend = F, fontface = \u0026quot;bold\u0026quot;, fill = \u0026quot;#ffffff66\u0026quot;) + theme_graph() + theme(legend.position = \u0026quot;none\u0026quot;) + labs(title = \u0026quot;Top 3 communities\u0026quot;) plot_ego Let\u0026rsquo;s use an alternative dataviz to identify the nodes.\nnetwork_viz %\u0026gt;% mutate(community = group_spinglass()) %\u0026gt;% ggraph(layout = \u0026quot;nicely\u0026quot;) + geom_edge_fan(alpha = 0.25) + geom_node_point(aes(color = factor(community)),size = 5, show.legend = F) + geom_node_text(aes(label = name),repel = T) + theme_graph() + theme(legend.position = \u0026quot;none\u0026quot;) + labs(title = \u0026quot;Network with named nodes\u0026quot;) Concluding words Not sure what the communities are about. Due to limitation with the Twitter API I did not attempt to retrieve the info on all the 5,000 followers, but I used only 35 of them, which explains why there is not much to say about this network I guess. I might take some time to try and retrieve all the info (will take days), or not. I might also use some information I already have, like how followers describe themselves and do some topic modelling to identify common themes of interest.\nHere I have simply followed the steps that Joe Cristian illustrated so brillantly in his post at https://algotech.netlify.app/blog/social-network-analysis-in-r/. Make sure you read his post for more details on the code and theory. In particular, he illustrates how information spreads through the network.\nFor more about social network analyses and Twitter, see this thread https://twitter.com/Mehdi_Moussaid/status/1389174715990876160?s=20 and this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX7YQ6m2r_o in French, this is what inspired me to do the analysis. See also this https://github.com/eleurent/twitter-graph for a much better analysis than what I could do (with Python for data retrieving and manipulation, and Gephi for network visualisation).\nThis post was also published on https://www.r-bloggers.com.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","date":1627430400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1627430400,"objectID":"40f652687c71880ce5f02374b6de0deb","permalink":"https://oliviergimenez.github.io/blog/twitter-social-network/","publishdate":"2021-07-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/twitter-social-network/","section":"blog","summary":"I use R to retrieve some data from Twitter, do some exploratory data analysis and visualisation and examine a network of followers.\n","tags":["Twitter","social network","R","rstats"],"title":"Quick and dirty analysis of a Twitter social network","type":"blog"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"It was awesome!\nBig day today 🥳 Hélène Labach is defending her PhD on the conservation of Bottlenose 🐬 in the French Mediterranean 🌊 @MIRACETI_ceta @cefemontpellier @umontpellier @CollegeDoctoUM @twitthair1 pic.twitter.com/RkbHSe415Q\n\u0026mdash;

To account for the human dimension inherent to these questions, I went back to the university to study sociology. A nice illustration of this interdisciplinary work is Gilles Maurer\u0026rsquo;s PhD combining anthropology, demography, economics and genetics to better understand the interactions between captive and wild population of Asian elephants.\nI\u0026rsquo;m doing my best to teach statistics (including the Bayesian way) to the students of the Ecology and Evolution Master in Montpellier.

I keep forgetting how to implement the so-called delta method in R that allows to get an approximation of this quantity. So in this post I go through two examples in population ecology that should help me remembering. I use the deltamethod function from the msm package.\nLoad the package msm and get some help on the delta-method function:\nlibrary(msm) ?deltamethod Further examples can be obtained by typing in:\nexample(deltamethod) For a nice introduction to the delta method, check that out. Two papers are worth reading on the topic: \u0026lsquo;Who Invented the Delta Method?\u0026rsquo; by Jay M. Ver Hoef and \u0026lsquo;Approximating variance of demographic parameters using the delta method: A reference for avian biologists\u0026rsquo; by Larkin A. Powell.\nSimple example A simple example is when, for example, you get $\\phi$ (ignore the traditional hat) an estimate of a survival probability on the logit scale in some capture-recapture analyses, and you would like to get the standard error (SE) of survival on its natural scale.\nFor example, say $\\text{logit}(\\phi) = \\text{lphi} = -0.4473122$ with $\\text{SE} = 0.3362757$.\nTo obtain $\\phi$, you back-transform $\\text{lphi}$ using the reciprocal function of the logit function: $$\\phi = \\displaystyle{\\frac{\\exp(\\text{lphi})}{1+\\exp(\\text{lphi})}} = \\displaystyle{\\frac{1}{1+\\exp(\\text{-lphi})}} = \\displaystyle{\\frac{1}{1+\\exp(\\text{-(-0.4473122)})}} = 0.39.$$\nWhat about the SE of $\\phi$? Well, a direct application of the deltamethod function from the msm package gives the answer:\ndeltamethod(~ 1/(1+exp(-x1)), -0.4473122, 0.3362757^2) ## [1] 0.07999999 Two things to take care of:\nFirst, the variables in the formula must be labelled $x_1, x_2, \\text{text}$. You cannot use $x, y, z, \u0026hellip;$ for example. Just numbered $x$\u0026rsquo;s.\nSecond, the input parameters are the estimate and its squared SE (not the SE), and by default you will get as an output the SE (not the squared SE) of the function defined by the formula.\nComplex example This example deals with an occupancy model. It is a bit more complex than the previous example because we consider a function of several parameters for which we would like to calculate its SE. I assume that occupancy at first occasion was estimated along with its SE, and that one would like to obtain the SE of subsequent occupancy probabilities.\nI calculate time-dependent occupancy probabilities with the following formula $$\\psi_{t+1} = \\psi_t (1 - \\varepsilon) + (1 - \\psi_t) \\gamma$$ where $\\varepsilon$ is extinction, $\\gamma$ is colonisation and $\\psi_t$ is occupancy year $t$.\nWe assume that we obtained the following parameter estimates:\nepsilon = 0.39 gamma = 0.07 psi_init = 0.1 # first-occasion occupancy with corresponding SEs:\nse_epsilon = 0.08 se_psi_init = 0.01 se_gamma = 0.05 We will estimate occupancy and get SEs at 10 occasions, which we store in two matrices (column vectors):\npsi = matrix(0, nrow = 10, ncol = 1) psi_se = matrix(0, nrow = 10, ncol = 1) The first element is occupancy at first occasion:\npsi[1,] \u0026lt;- psi_init psi_se[1,] \u0026lt;- se_psi_init Then we iterate calculations using the formula above:\nfor(i in 2:10){ psi_current \u0026lt;- psi[i-1,] psi_se_current \u0026lt;- psi_se[i-1,] estmean \u0026lt;- c(psi_current,epsilon,gamma) estvar \u0026lt;- diag(c(psi_se_current,se_epsilon,se_gamma)^2) psi[i,] = (psi_current*(1-epsilon)) + ((1-psi_current)*gamma) # recurrence formula psi_se[i,] = deltamethod(~ x1*(1-x2) + (1-x1)*x3, estmean, estvar) # delta-method } Display results:\ndata.frame(psi = psi,sterr_psi = psi_se) ## psi sterr_psi ## 1 0.1000000 0.01000000 ## 2 0.1240000 0.04602347 ## 3 0.1369600 0.05132740 ## 4 0.1439584 0.05244394 ## 5 0.1477375 0.05259904 ## 6 0.1497783 0.05255782 ## 7 0.1508803 0.05250010 ## 8 0.1514753 0.05245886 ## 9 0.1517967 0.05243372 ## 10 0.1519702 0.05241934 Here, we assumed that sampling correlation was 0, in other words that the estimates of $\\psi$, $\\gamma$ and $\\epsilon$ were independent, hence the use of a diagonal matrix for estvar.

The code is available from [GitHub](https://github.com/oliviergimenez/simul_with_jags). Recently, I have been struggling with simulating data from complex hierarchical models. After several unsuccessful attempts in R, I remembered the good old times when I was using WinBUGS (more than 10 years already!) and the possibility to simulate data with it. I\u0026rsquo;m using JAGS now, and a quick search in Google with \u0026lsquo;simulating data with jags\u0026rsquo; led me to a complex example and a simple example.\nSimulating data with JAGS is convenient because you can use (almost) the same code for simulation and inference, and you can carry out simulation studies (bias, precision, interval coverage) in the same environment (namely JAGS).\nLinear regression example We first load the packages we need for this tutorial:\nlibrary(R2jags) library(runjags) library(mcmcplots) Then straight to the point, let\u0026rsquo;s generate data from a linear regression model. The trick is to use a data block, have the simplest model block you could think of and pass the parameters as if they were data. Note that it\u0026rsquo;d be possible to use only a model block, see comment here.\ntxtstring \u0026lt;- ' data{ # Likelihood: for (i in 1:N){ y[i] ~ dnorm(mu[i], tau) # tau is precision (1 / variance) mu[i] \u0026lt;- alpha + beta * x[i] } } model{ fake \u0026lt;- 0 } ' Here, alpha and beta are the intercept and slope, tau the precision or the inverse of the variance, y the response variable and x the explanatory variable.\nWe pick some values for the model parameters that we will use as data:\n# parameters for simulations N = 30 # nb of observations x \u0026lt;- 1:N # predictor alpha = 0.5 # intercept beta = 1 # slope sigma \u0026lt;- .1 # residual sd tau \u0026lt;- 1/(sigma*sigma) # precision # parameters are treated as data for the simulation step data\u0026lt;-list(N=N,x=x,alpha=alpha,beta=beta,tau=tau) Now call JAGS; note that we monitor the response variable instead of parameters as we would do when conducting standard inference:\n# run jags out \u0026lt;- run.jags(txtstring, data = data,monitor=c(\u0026quot;y\u0026quot;),sample=1, n.chains=1, summarise=FALSE) ## Compiling rjags model... ## Calling the simulation using the rjags method... ## Note: the model did not require adaptation ## Burning in the model for 4000 iterations... ## Running the model for 1 iterations... ## Simulation complete ## Finished running the simulation The output is a bit messy and needs to be formatted appropriately:\n# reformat the outputs Simulated \u0026lt;- coda::as.mcmc(out) Simulated ## Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) output: ## Start = 5001 ## End = 5001 ## Thinning interval = 1 ## y[1] y[2] y[3] y[4] y[5] y[6] y[7] y[8] ## 5001 1.288399 2.52408 3.61516 4.583587 5.600675 6.566052 7.593407 8.457497 ## y[9] y[10] y[11] y[12] y[13] y[14] y[15] y[16] ## 5001 9.70847 10.38035 11.5105 12.55048 13.49143 14.46356 15.45641 16.56148 ## y[17] y[18] y[19] y[20] y[21] y[22] y[23] ## 5001 17.50935 18.51501 19.66197 20.49477 21.57079 22.6199 23.48232 ## y[24] y[25] y[26] y[27] y[28] y[29] y[30] ## 5001 24.57923 25.47368 26.33674 27.46525 28.35525 29.60279 30.42952 dim(Simulated) ## [1] 1 30 dat = as.vector(Simulated) dat ## [1] 1.288399 2.524080 3.615160 4.583587 5.600675 6.566052 7.593407 ## [8] 8.457497 9.708470 10.380351 11.510500 12.550482 13.491435 14.463564 ## [15] 15.456410 16.561483 17.509350 18.515005 19.661969 20.494767 21.570790 ## [22] 22.619899 23.482317 24.579228 25.473676 26.336736 27.465251 28.355248 ## [29] 29.602791 30.429517 Now let\u0026rsquo;s fit the model we used to simulate to the data we just generated.

I also have students who are now in the position to apply for such positions. It had me thinking about what works and what doesn't work in job applications and interviews. Here are my 2 cents suggestions. You can find plenty of more clever and relevant recommendations on the internet (see here, here or here for example). Also, be aware that these recommendations are specific to the French system, with little relevance for other countries.\nYour application\nRead and stick to the guidelines (not that obvious sometimes). The French academic system has some specific requirements to apply, in particular for faculty positions. Try to connect your CV with the job profile.\nDo not hesitate to include figures and boxes in the document. Structure does not hurt, well articulated sections are welcome. Be crystal clear on your current position. Synthetic tables summarizing the courses you taught, the talks you gave, the papers you published will help the referees to grab what is important in a minute (they obviously have more than your application to evaluate). Distinguish papers from oral presentations.\nSubmitted papers do not \u0026lsquo;count\u0026rsquo;. Use preprint servers such as arXiv or bioRxiv so that your referees get a chance to read what you\u0026rsquo;ve been working on lately (and judge the quality by themselves).\nProject yourself in the team/lab where the researcher will be hosted, and in the job itself. Feel free to get in touch with the host team/lab. Try to meet people beforehand. Visit websites. Get to know your hopefully-soon-to-be new lab. Show you\u0026rsquo;re interested in working with your hopefully-soon-to-be new colleagues. This might also help you find out about the \u0026lsquo;dismal job that everyone has been avoiding for years\u0026rsquo;.\nFor lecturer positions, even though it is not required, write a short project section including research objectives and do not forget your teaching objectives!\nHave your applications read by one or two colleagues, if possible someone who has experience in being on the kind of hiring committee you will have to face.\nYour interview\nBe on site the day before ( strikes in France happen).\nAppearances do matter, whether you like it or not, therefore pick something neutral and comfortable (my opinion).\nDo not use slides with too much text or complex figures (no tables please!), and point at your slides so that your visual support is part of your speech. Don\u0026rsquo;t look at the screen or the walls, try to look at the members of the jury. Occupy the space, don\u0026rsquo;t always stay at the same spot, but do not move too much (I\u0026rsquo;m useless at that).\nDo not rush when you talk, and give short answers so that every member of the committee gets a chance to ask you a question. Be honest: if you don\u0026rsquo;t know something, or if you don\u0026rsquo;t understand a question (which most likely means that members of the hiring committee do not understand this question either), say it.\nLast, but not least: rehearse, rehearse and rehearse again, there will be a moment where you do no longer sound like you know your text by heart, but rather, like saying it has become natural.\nFrom my experience, the round of questions is more determinant than the talk itself, but we have very rare opportunities to train on how to answer questions. Try to have sessions of questions with your colleagues to get better at it; it comes with experience, no secret.\nFor short talks in general, my advice is to write your text, at least for the first slides so that you\u0026rsquo;re confident you won\u0026rsquo;t get stuck when you start giving your speech. Make a video of yourself rehearsing and watch it; this is painful (I know by experience), but helpful.\nShow that you\u0026rsquo;re excited by the job offer, and that you like teaching and doing research. At the end of the day, I (sadly) vividly remember only a few candidates, most often those who demonstrated interest in the job and pleasure in doing what they do. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t good at inspiring that myself, but one thing that helped me was to think hard why I was applying, and to convince myself that I wanted the job so badly that I had to convince the committee that they should offer the job to me.\nLast but not least, do not do the job of the committee for the committee. In other words, do not censor yourself. Apply, and let the referees do their job.\nGood luck!\n","date":1502712000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1502712000,"objectID":"67174cc607328aa6d1a8b49954e4f365","permalink":"https://oliviergimenez.github.io/blog/interview_inra/","publishdate":"2017-08-14T12:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/interview_inra/","section":"blog","summary":" Over the years (age privilege), I sat on several hiring committees for French universities and research institutes.

Iago will spend next year improving his (already largely above the average) skills in informatics, AI, programming, agent-based modeling\u0026hellip; Hopefully, we’ll work again together.

For this special day, we opted for a particular format, with less science than usual, the idea being to show what’s going on behind the scenes. We had a roundtable on the link between research, managers and citizens. We also had several short unorthodox talks where we tried to analyse why some of our papers/projects were successful, but also why we failed at being read or funded.
