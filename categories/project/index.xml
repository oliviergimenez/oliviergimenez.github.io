      <description>&lt;p&gt;Large carnivores are difficult to monitor in the field: they are elusive and live at low densities over wide areas. With their recent recovery in Europe,
large carnivores are having increasing interactions with human activities. We contribute to the estimation of their abundance and distribution by applying
and developing methods that make optimal use of available data. We are also working on applying science-based management using the structured
decision making framework. Past and ongoing projects were are are mostly led by 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://oliviergimenez.github.io/#current&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Master students, PhDs and post-docs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
