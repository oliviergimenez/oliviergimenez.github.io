working with Eric Marboutin and Christophe Duchamp from
&lt;a href="http://www.oncfs.gouv.fr/" target="_blank">ONCFS&lt;/a>. There will be
also collaborations with
&lt;a href="http://www.nina.no/english/Contact/Employees/Employee-info/AnsattID/12310" target="_blank">John
Linnell &lt;/a>from NINA. She&amp;rsquo;ll be studying the various ways to assess the distribution of
large carnivores and methods to optimise the associated monitoring protocols.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Awesome master students</title><link>https://oliviergimenez.github.io/blog/master_2015/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jun 2015 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://oliviergimenez.github.io/blog/master_2015/</guid><description>&lt;p>My 2 master students finished their internships. I was
so lucky to have them and work with them. Iago worked on the estimation of abundance
using bilateral photo-identification capture-recapture data, with an application to
bottlenose dolphins. He made a very neat contribution to the field by greatly
improving existing algorithms
(&lt;a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/biom.12045/abstract" target="_blank">here&lt;/a> and
&lt;a href="http://www.esajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1890/12-1613.1" target="_blank">here&lt;/a>) to
fit capture-recapture models to these non-standard data. Julie worked on inferring the
distribution of wolves in France from the beginning of its recolonization in the early 90’s.
Her main contribution was to show that by carefully describing observers’ characteristics
and properly quantify the prospection effort, citizen science data can be used to map the
range dynamics of species with large dispersal distances and home ranges. Iago will
spend next year improving his (already largely above the average) skills in informatics,
AI, programming, agent-based modeling&amp;hellip; Hopefully, we’ll work again together. Julie is
applying for PhD grants, more soon.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
