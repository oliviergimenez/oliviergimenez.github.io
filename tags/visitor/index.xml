Newcastle in Australia, who visited us back in 2015, is with us again for a short 3-week
visit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We resumed the work we started one year ago on developing a method to combine
sources of information on species distribution. We also started a new project on model
selection in occupancy and capture-recapture models using the LASSO.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Another visit of Raluca Bancila</title><link>https://oliviergimenez.github.io/blog/raluca_visit2/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Oct 2016 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://oliviergimenez.github.io/blog/raluca_visit2/</guid><description>&lt;p>

back in 2015, is with us again for a short 2-week visit. We will resume a project we
started one year ago on the evaluation of demographic parameters of two related species
of spadefoot toads (Pelobates syriacus and P. fuscus) from the

&lt;a href="http://www.math.uvic.ca/~lcowen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Laura Cowen&lt;/a> from the Department of Math and Stat
at University of Victoria (Canada) will be on a sabbatical with us for 3 months.
We will be working on the applications of hidden Markov models to capture-recapture data.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ian Renner's visit</title><link>https://oliviergimenez.github.io/blog/ian_first_visit/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Oct 2015 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://oliviergimenez.github.io/blog/ian_first_visit/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.newcastle.edu.au/profile/ian-renner" target="_blank">Ian Renner&lt;/a> from
the University of Newcastle in Australia spent some time with us while on a sabbatical.
We worked together on developing a method to combine sources of information on species
distribution. Ian brought his sound expertise on the Lasso for covariate selection and
point processes that provide a nice integrated framework. It was fun to program in R
in parallel. I wish I could do that more often. We even managed (credit goes to Ian)
to present something at the
International Statistical Ecology Conference.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>On a personal side, Ian has
become a friend, his kindness and interest in other people are amazing.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Raluca Bancila's visit</title><link>https://oliviergimenez.github.io/blog/raluca_visit1/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Oct 2015 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://oliviergimenez.github.io/blog/raluca_visit1/</guid><description>&lt;p>I had the visit of &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Raluca_Bancila" target="_blank">Raluca
Bancila&lt;/a> a research scientist from Romania. We investigated spatio-temporal environmental variation
in and individual heterogeneity on emigration/immigration rates of the
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troglofauna" target="_blank">troglophile harvestmen
species&lt;/a> Paranemastoma silli with capture-recapture models. We used two P. silli populations
inhabiting two caves, Closani and Lazului Caves, located in the Mehedinti Mountains in southwestern
Romania. Yes, we do not only work on big emblematic mammal species ;-)
On a personal side, Raluca is always smiling and laughing – ‘la banane’ like we say in French,
it was so good to have her in the team. I’m looking forward to hosting her again!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Visitors from Berlin</title><link>https://oliviergimenez.github.io/blog/visit_from_izw/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2015 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://oliviergimenez.github.io/blog/visit_from_izw/</guid><description>&lt;p>I had the visit of Sarah Benhaim and Lucile Marescot (a former PhD student of mine),
both post-doc at the Leibniz Institute in Berlin supervised
by &lt;a href="http://www.izw-berlin.de/kramer-schadt-stefanie.html" target="_blank">Stephanie
Kramer-Schadt&lt;/a>. It was an exciting week that we spent discussing and analyzing
data on the spotted hyenas from the Serengeti National Park with questions at the
interface of demography, sociality and epidemiology. This is joint work with Heribert
Hofer and Marion East.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Nina Santostasi's visit</title><link>https://oliviergimenez.github.io/blog/nina_visit/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Apr 2015 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://oliviergimenez.github.io/blog/nina_visit/</guid><description>&lt;p>I had the visit of Nina Santostasi from Italy to work for a few days on the estimation
of striped dolphin abundance in the gulf of Corinth (in Greece). Nina is working with
Giovanni Bearzi and Silvia Bonizzoni from the &lt;a href="http://www.dolphinbiology.org/about.htm" target="_blank">NGO
Dolphin Biology&lt;/a> and Conservation. Hopefully our collaboration will provide elements
for the conservation of the species.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Jim Sedinger's sabbatical</title><link>https://oliviergimenez.github.io/blog/jim_sedinger/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2014 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://oliviergimenez.github.io/blog/jim_sedinger/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.ag.unr.edu/sedinger/" target="_blank">Jim Sedinger&lt;/a>, professor
at the University of Nevada (Reno), said goodbye to the team after 3 months with us
on a sabbatical. It’s been great to have Jim here analyzing data collected as part
of the amazing Black Brant monitoring initiated in the 40s. More soon on our joint
project on senescence and individual heterogeneity.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Economy and large carnivores</title><link>https://oliviergimenez.github.io/blog/economy_wolf/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jun 2014 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://oliviergimenez.github.io/blog/economy_wolf/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.uwyo.edu/agecon/about%20us/facultystaff/faculty%20pages/benjamin%20rashford.html" target="_blank">Ben
