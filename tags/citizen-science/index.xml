Congress on Biological Conservation&lt;/a> that was held in my home town Montpellier.
The students of our team were on fire and talked about their exciting work. Gilles
presented a
bio-economic model to study the population dynamics of Asian captive elephants,
a nice example of how to explicitly incorporate interactions between captive and wild
populations in species management.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Julie talked about her use of opportunistic data to map the colonisation of the wolf in France; this is a neat
example of how to generate non-detections by carefully assessing the observation efforts
to use dynamic occupancy models.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anne-Sophie presented
an
application of Poisson point process modeling to map the presence of brown bear presence in
Greece using citizen science data with possible observer bias.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Blaise presented his
results on a
sociological survey to assess the attitudes of local residents towards the presence of Brown
bears in the Pyrenees.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Last, Laetitia had a poster on the use of
a
spatially explicit individual-based model to explore the best strategies (reintroductions
and / or corridors) to restore the population of lynx in the Vosges mountains.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I
gave a talk
on a
review of the methods to analyse citizen science data. This was part of a symposium (nicely
summarised by Muki Haklay &lt;a href="https://povesham.wordpress.com/2015/08/04/notes-from-iccbeccb-2015-day-2-citizen-science-data-quality/" target="_blank">here&lt;/a>)
organised by Karine Princé and Wes Hochachka. Stay tuned, a paper is on its way!&lt;/p>
&lt;iframe src="https://widgets.figshare.com/articles/4833110/embed?show_title=1" width="568" height="351" frameborder="0">&lt;/iframe>
&lt;p>Overall, the program
of this conference was dense, the talks and discussions between sessions were stimulating,
I’m looking forward to attending the next one!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Workshop on citizen science and statistics</title><link>https://oliviergimenez.github.io/blog/cs_meeting/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Oct 2014 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://oliviergimenez.github.io/blog/cs_meeting/</guid><description>&lt;p>After a month off, I’m back to work starting with a 2-day workshop on citizen sciences
I’ve co-organised with Romain Julliard and Pascal Monestiez
(
&lt;a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/23160641/my-pubs/prog_16_17_octobre_v4.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">program&lt;/a>)
as part of
&lt;a href="https://sites.google.com/site/gdrecostat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our group on Statistical Ecology&lt;/a>
and on citizen sciences
&lt;a href="http://ciam.inra.fr/cisstats/accueil" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CiSStats&lt;/a>. The discussions
were stimulating with a nice balance between talks given by data providers on the first
day and modelers on the second day. I gave a talk based on Anne-Sophie’s work on
mapping brown bear distribution in Greece using opportunistic data. Slides below:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Check out below Anne-Sophie&amp;rsquo;s
talk she gave at the 2014 International
Conference on Bear Research and Management in Thessaloniki (Greece) and at the
joint BES-SFE
Ecology conference in Lille.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
