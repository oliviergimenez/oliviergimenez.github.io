on COMmunity dynamics – Developing multi-species DEMOgraphy&amp;rdquo; will be funded by
&lt;a href="http://www.agence-nationale-recherche.fr/en/project-based-funding-to-advance-french-research/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ANR&lt;/a>!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I submitted it in April for the third time. I originally submitted it (just once) to the
&lt;a href="https://erc.europa.eu/funding/starting-grants" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ERC&lt;/a> back in 2011,
it was rejected. Over the years, we received constructive comments from referees that helped
improving the project, and made it more solid.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In DEMOCOM, we will develop an integrated statistical
framework for estimation and inference about community dynamics via the development of a multispecies
demography, bringing together concepts, predictions and tools from both fields of demography and community ecology.
We will apply this new framework to case studies on fishes, mammals and birds.
The methods will be made available through R packages.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is a collaborative project
with many partners involved, and people to be hired (stay tuned). The project will start early 2017, more soon.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Research grant on human-dolphin interactions</title><link>https://oliviergimenez.github.io/blog/interact/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jun 2016 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://oliviergimenez.github.io/blog/interact/</guid><description>&lt;p>Great news! Our project on &amp;ldquo;Scenarios for coexistence between men and dolphins on the Mediterranean
French littoral&amp;rdquo; will be funded by
&lt;a href="https://www.fondationdefrance.org/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fondation de France&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this project, we will propose management strategies for human activities and populations of bottlenose dolphins to coexist.
Building on the
&lt;a href="https://www.gdegem.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GDEGeM project&lt;/a>, we will adopt an ecological approach to infer the spatio-temporal
distribution of dolphins and their interactions with human activities, and a sociological
approach to explore the attitudes and perceptions of local actors towards dolphins.
We will resort to participatory modeling to build, test and use a model to assess
management strategies collectively.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In passing, I kind of liked the selection procedure:
we first submitted a written application, then were asked to come for an interview.
I could answer the questions of the committee and have a direct feeling of what they
were thinking of our project.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We will start this project officially by the end of
the year, more soon.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Biodiversa grant submission</title><link>https://oliviergimenez.github.io/blog/biodiversa/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jul 2015 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://oliviergimenez.github.io/blog/biodiversa/</guid><description>&lt;p>Just submitted a big proposal to the
&lt;a href="http://www.biodiversa.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Biodiversa
call&lt;/a>. It was great to write this project
with
&lt;a href="https://lbbe.univ-lyon1.fr/-Fritz-Herve-.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hervé Fritz&lt;/a> who,
without a doubt, knows how to write grant applications! If successful, we&amp;rsquo;ll be
working on the social and ecological dimensions of connectivity in lynx habitats.
This is joint work with French, Swiss, German, Norwegian and Swedish colleagues.
More soon hopefully.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Update&lt;/strong>: On May 2016, I received the news that our project was rejected.
Big disappointment. But hey, that&amp;rsquo;s life, and this project is awesome,
we&amp;rsquo;ll find other ways to implement it!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
